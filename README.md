This is the official implementation of our **ICML 2020** paper *Lifted Disjoint Paths with Application in Multiple Object Tracking* ([Andrea Hornakova](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning/people/andrea-hornakova), [Roberto Henschel](http://www.tnt.uni-hannover.de/staff/henschel/), [Bodo Rosenhahn](http://www.tnt.uni-hannover.de/en/staff/rosenhahn/), [Paul Swoboda](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning/people/paul-swoboda/)) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14550].

We provide the solver implemented in C++, along with a Python wrapper.
The tracker is implemented in Matlab.
